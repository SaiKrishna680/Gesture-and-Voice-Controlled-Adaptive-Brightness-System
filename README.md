# 🌟 Smart Brightness & Accessibility Control using Computer Vision

A real-time smart system that controls **screen brightness and display accessibility modes** using **hand gestures, voice commands, and face proximity detection**. This project leverages **Computer Vision and AI** to enhance visual comfort, especially in low-light and visually sensitive environments.

## 🚀 Features

✨ Hand gesture-based brightness control  
🎙️ Voice command support for hands-free operation  
👤 Face proximity-based adaptive brightness  
🌙 Night mode with blue light reduction  
🎨 Grayscale (bedtime) mode  
🔅 Extra-dim mode for low-light usage  
🔄 Color inversion for visual accessibility  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The webcam captures real-time video using **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe Hands** detects 21 hand landmarks to interpret gestures
- **MediaPipe Face Detection** estimates face distance to adjust brightness
- **SpeechRecognition** processes voice commands to toggle modes
- **ScreenBrightnessControl** updates system brightness dynamically

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **SpeechRecognition**
- **NumPy**
- **ScreenBrightnessControl**
- **Webcam (Real-Time Video Input)**
